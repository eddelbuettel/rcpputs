Rcpp bindings for UTS (Unevenly Spaced Time Series)

### What is UTS?

UTS is a library by [Andreas Eckner](http://eckner.com/index.html) described and made
available via his [research page](http://eckner.com/research.html) which also contains
a [zip archive](http://eckner.com/papers/uts_algorithms.zip). 

### What is RcppUTS?

This package wraps UTS for use by R via [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html).

Some examples are included, based on the example in the UTS library.

### What else?

Well once I told Andreas I was putting together a quick package, he got motivated too and
released [an updated GitHUb repo for uts](https://github.com/andreas50/uts) as well
[one for utsOperators](https://github.com/andreas50/utsOperators). You probably want to
watch those spaces.

### Status

The package builds and check cleanly.  

More functionality could be added, of course. Contributions are welcome.

### Author

Dirk Eddelbuettel for the package and interface, Andreas Eckner for UTS.
